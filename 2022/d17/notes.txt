Rocks get 4 jets applied before landing (maybe 5 with some shapes & floot
patterns?). So there are 16 or 32 possible jet patterns.

So that's 224 or 448 possible scenarios for each rock (5 rock shapes). That's
not that many, might be faster than simulating.

Except one layer of "floor" pattern isn't enough, and actually I guess a lot
more jets could be applied to, e.g., the vertical block pieces depending on how
it works out.
